reference. the parties agree and acknowledge that the square footage figure stipulated herein is a general figure which shall serve as the square footage of the leased premises for the purpose of calculating base rent under this lease, regardless of any actual measurements of the interior space of the leased premises, and regardless of any permitted alterations which the tenant may make to the interior of the leased premises. the ground floor footprint of 189 rentable square feet shall be used for all other purposes under this lease, including, but not limited to, the calculation of

maintenance and repair issues, insurance and common utility issues, etc. and shall have sole authority in this regard, with such authority to be exercised in landlords reasonable discretion. as used here, tenants proportionate share shall be calculated with tenants stipulated square footage of the footprint of the leased premises as the numerator and the total square footage of the building as the denominator. it is acknowledged that the amount assessed for common area maintenance and repair may change from time to time. such variations of actual cost in relation to the actual amount of triple net fees paid by tenant will be reviewed and accounted for by landlord and reported to tenant by april 30 of the following year. based on landlords annual review and accounting, any surplus or deficit of tenant triple net payments paid in the prior year shall be credited or debited, respectively, to the tenant by the landlord. the landlord shall set the new estimated triple net expenses amount for the coming year based on anticipated costs, and tenant shall agree to pay one-twelfth of such annual prorata charges concurrently with the base rent. all of such additional charges shall be

and reconciliation of actual expenses, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the lease prior to the date of such end-of-year review; and conversely, landlord shall remain obligated to

base rents shall increase or decrease pursuant to paragraph 3 above for the one-year renewal terms . for clarification, the base rental amounts do not include the monthly triple net expense charges also to be paid monthly described in paragraph 4c-d above. 5. security deposit a security deposit of $ 2,381.36 will be paid by the tenant upon the commencement date and held by the landlord at all times while this lease is in effect. the parties acknowledge that this amount is already in the possession of landlord, being the security deposit amount from the previous lease term. the security deposit shall be held by landlord without liability for interest and as security for the full and timely performance by tenant of tenants covenants and obligations under this lease, it being expressly understood that the security deposit shall not be considered an advance payment of rental or a measure or limitation of landlords damages in case of default by tenant. unless otherwise provided by mandatory non-waivable law or regulation, landlord may co-mingle the security deposit with landlords other funds. if the landlord must apply any part of the security deposit to cure any default of tenant hereunder, but the lease remains in effect, the tenant shall promptly pay to the landlord upon demand such amount as will restore the full balance of the security deposit to its original $ 2,381.36 amount. if the leased premises are in substantially as good a condition, reasonable and normal wear and tear excepted, as exists upon the commencement of this tenancy, and tenant is not in default under any other provisions of this lease and is current in all payments owed to landlord, the entire security deposit, or balance thereof after any such application to cure any default, shall be returned without interest to tenant within a reasonable time after the expiration or termination of this lease. landlord may, however, retain an amount from the security deposit as is reasonably estimated to cover any projected shortfall in tenants triple net payments as have not been reconciled at the time of the termination of this lease. 6. use tenant agrees to use the

of insurance or cancellation of any insurance policy. tenant specifically acknowledges and agrees that tenant shall be responsible for taking such steps as are necessary to insure that the walls,

tenants cost, to comply with all applicable municipal, county, state, and federal laws and regulations now in force or which may hereafter be enforced concerning tenants particular use of the leased premises. it is understood, however, that the landlord is responsible for building modifications required by governmental agencies to ensure that the leased premises are in compliance with the ada and

further, landlord and its agents shall have the right to reasonable access to the leased premises at reasonable times upon no less than twenty-four hours prior notice to ascertain whether the leased premises are in good repair and or to make such repairs or maintenance which landlord may be required to make or feel desirable. the requirement of advance notice shall not apply in situations deemed to be an emergency by the landlord . the parties acknowledge that an alarm system for the premises is present and may be used by the tenant. activation, repair service and monthly monitoring fees for this alarm are the responsibility of the tenant. at all times during the term of this lease, should the alarm system be activated, tenant shall insure that landlord has the current alarm access code in order that landlord may enter the leased premises for the purposes contemplated by this lease, and tenant shall provide such code to landlord upon request at any time. further, tenant understands and acknowledges that an interior fire sprinkler system has been constructed in the building prior to the outset of this lease and has its riser station and controls located within unit a of the leased premises. landlord, and its contractors, shall have reasonable access to this space as needed to service and maintain such fire sprinkler control station, and or to permit the periodic inspection of the system by service contractors, the city and or fire department officials as may be required. 17. repair and maintenance at its expense, tenant shall keep the interior of the leased

window or door breakage caused by burglary or vandalism, or by unknown cause, or by tenant, its employees, agents, or business invitees whether by tenant abuse or misuse, tenant shall repair the

snow removal in the winter. the contractor is required to remove snow on the parking lots and sidewalks when snow accumulations equal or exceed 2. since snow fall is random and often frequent, and snow removal contractors typically have many accounts, the landlord does not guarantee in any way the parking lots or walkways will be cleared of snow immediately after any snow fall or be cleared by any specific time of day. therefore, it is recommended that the tenant have a hand snow shovel and at times be willing and able to clear its own walkway in from of its units door, should the need arise. osterman drive is a city street and is not required to be cleared of snow by the landlord, and the landlord makes no guarantee as to the navigability of the street in the winter. however, on rare occasion, the snow removal contractor will partially clear the street if absolutely necessary at the landlords request. any additional fee charged for such service will be considered a common area maintenance fee and the tenant agrees to pay its pro-rata share. the snow removal contractor is requested to place snow outside the parking area and not block parking stalls or the designated loading zone with accumulated or plowed snow. however, since snow fall is unpredictable the landlord makes no guarantee that some portion of parking spaces or the loading zone will not be partially or completely obstructed by snow piles. also, the use of any snow removal chemical or salt substance such as ice melt or other snow or ice melting products on the sidewalks by the tenant is strictly prohibited. the landlord provides each tenant a container of traction sand for the purpose of increasing safety on potentially slippery walkways. the traction sand is free of charge to all tenants in the building and is to be used by the tenant in reasonable amounts at its discretion. 18. cleanliness and waste tenant shall keep the leased premises, inside and outside, in a neat, clean, and sanitary condition, free from waste and other debris. receptacles are provided for trash and recycling cardboard and must be used accordingly. tenant shall not place trash or cardboard outside the receptacles. tenant shall not allow any hazardous substances to be deposited or remain in or about the leased premises. tenant shall store all items pertaining to its business operations inside the leased premises and not in common parking or walk areas. tenant shall not allow hazardous or legally prohibited liquids or solids to be placed in the sewer system or in the grounds in the area of the leased premises. at the termination of this lease, tenant shall clean and repair any and all soiling and/or damages to the leased premises, including marks, scratches, holes, dirt, and grease, and damages to the walls, floors, floor coverings, ceilings, and fixtures, normal wear and tear excepted. it is a general management policy of the landlord that pets are not allowed in the building or on the premises, with the exception of bona fide service animals and other animals specifically approved by landlord cigarette or cigar smoking is not allowed at any time in the building and is only permitted outside the building at a distance of at least 30 feet from doorways or windows. all cigarettes and cigars must be extinguished and disposed of properly and safely. littering the premises is not permitted. 19. liens tenant shall not permit any lien to be attached to the leased premises by reason of any act or omission on its part and agrees to save and hold landlord harmless from or against such lien or claim of lien. if any lien does attach and any claim of lien is made and shall not be released within fifteen days after notice from landlord to tenant to release the same, landlord, at its option, may pay and discharge the same. in this case, the amount paid by landlord shall be added to and become part of the next succeeding installment of rent, shall be deemed rent payable hereunder, and shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent from the date advanced by landlord until paid; provided, however, if tenant desires in good faith to contest the validity of any such lien, it may do so and in such event landlord shall not discharge the lien and assess additional rent until the validity of the lien is legally established.	aug 1, 2015

6qa, and associated common property including parking and as depicted in the floor plan exhibit a attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. the parties agree and acknowledge that the square footage figure stipulated herein is a general figure which shall serve as the square footage of the leased premises for the purpose of calculating base rent under this lease, regardless of any actual measurements of the interior space of the leased premises, and regardless of any permitted alterations which the tenant may make to the interior of the leased premises. the ground floor footprint of 215 rentable square feet shall be used for all other purposes under this lease, including, but not limited to, the calculation of tenants prorata triple net expenses hereunder as defined

calendar days prior to the expiration of the then current lease term or renewal term. failure to give timely written notice of the exercise of the renewal option in this manner shall constitute a

base rent in the annual sum of $ 105,603.00 as adjusted for 2019 by the cpi formula set forth above, payable in twelve equal monthly amounts. base rent shall adjust annually for all lease years during

repair issues, insurance and common utility issues, etc. and shall have sole authority in this regard, with such authority to be exercised in landlords reasonable discretion. as used here, tenants proportionate share shall be calculated with tenants stipulated square footage of the footprint of the leased premises as the numerator and the total square footage of the building as the denominator. it is acknowledged that the amount assessed for common area maintenance and repair may change from time to time. such variations of actual cost in relation to the actual amount of triple net fees paid by tenant will be reviewed and accounted for by landlord and reported to tenant by april 30 of the following year. based on landlords annual review and accounting, any surplus or deficit of tenant triple net payments paid in the prior year shall be credited or debited, respectively, to the tenant by the landlord. the landlord shall set the new estimated triple net expenses amount for the coming year based on anticipated costs, and tenant shall agree to pay one-twelfth of such annual prorata charges concurrently with the base rent. all of such additional charges shall be termed the triple net expenses. tenant shall remain liable to pay to landlord upon demand any deficiency in the triple net expenses as may be determined to exist by the landlords end-of-year review and reconciliation of actual expenses, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the lease prior to the date of such end-of-year review; and conversely, landlord shall remain obligated to reimburse tenant any sum as tenant may have overpaid in triple net expenses as may be determined by such end-of-year review, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the lease prior to such

from the completion date. if any litigation, claim, or audit pertaining to this lease is started before the expiration of the three year period, the records must be retained until the litigation, claim, or audit findings have been resolved. d. triple net expenses are estimated for the 2019 portion of the first lease year of the initial lease term to be $1.95 per square foot per year , payable monthly with the base rent in an amount of $2,519.56. triple net expenses shall be in effect and payable upon occupancy 01/02/19, and continuing through the initial lease term and renewal terms if applicable. e. tenant shall pay a late fee of five percent of any base rent or triple net expense payment that is not paid on or before the end of the business day on the tenth of each month. f. the base rents shall increase or decrease pursuant to paragraph 3 above for the one-year renewal terms . for clarification, the base rental amounts do not include the monthly triple net expense charges also to be paid monthly described in paragraph 4c-d above. 5. security deposit a security deposit of $880.03 will be paid by the tenant upon the commencement date and held by the landlord at all times while this lease is in effect. the parties acknowledge that this amount is already in the possession of landlord, being the security deposit amount from the previous lease term. the security deposit shall be held by landlord without liability for interest and as security for the full and timely performance by tenant of tenants covenants and obligations under this lease, it being expressly understood that the security deposit shall not be considered an advance payment of rental or a measure or limitation of landlords damages in case of default by tenant. unless otherwise provided by mandatory non-waivable law or regulation, landlord may co-mingle the security deposit with landlords other funds. if the landlord must apply any part of the security deposit to cure any default of tenant hereunder, but the lease remains in effect, the tenant shall promptly pay to the landlord upon demand such amount as will restore the full balance of the security deposit to its original $880.03 amount. if the leased premises are in substantially as good a condition, reasonable and normal wear and tear excepted, as exists upon the commencement of this tenancy, and tenant is not in default under any other provisions of this lease and is current in all payments owed to landlord, the entire security deposit, or balance thereof after any such application to cure any default, shall be returned without interest to tenant within a reasonable time after the expiration or termination of this lease. landlord may, however, retain an amount from the security deposit as is reasonably estimated to cover any projected shortfall in tenants triple net payments as have not been reconciled at the time of the termination of this lease. 6. use tenant agrees to use the leased premises for

unreasonably withheld or delayed. in this connection, tenant covenants and warrants unto landlord that tenant has all applicable governmental licenses for the conduct of such business, and that tenant will not use the premises for any illegal or unlawful purpose or purposes, nor for any purpose or purposes which may unreasonably affect the general publics or building occupants health, safety, and welfare, or the welfare of the leased premises, nor for any purpose which will increase risks covered by insurance on the premises and result in an increase of the rate of insurance or cancellation of any insurance policy. tenant specifically acknowledges and agrees that tenant shall be responsible for taking such steps as are necessary to insure that the walls, flooring, and ceiling of the leased premises are adequately protected from any moisture or water damage as might result from tenants operations in the leased premises, including making such alterations or installing certain coverings or coatings on walls, floors, and or ceilings as will protect same, subject to landlords prior approval as to such measures under paragraph 9 below. 7. parking tenant acknowledges that the parking lot in front and rear of the building is for the joint use by all of the tenants in the building and their guests and invitees and that there are no designated or reserved parking spaces. parking spaces may not be used for storage of any kind including non-operating vehicles without the expressed written consent of the landlord. tenant acknowledges that snow removal activities during the winter may cause an accumulation of plowed snow in one or more areas of the parking lot which may reduce the amount of parking available to the buildings tenants and their guests and invitees and or which may impact the available space of the loading zone, on this seasonal basis. 8. compliance with public authorities tenant agrees, at tenants cost, to comply with all applicable municipal, county, state, and federal laws and regulations now in force or which may hereafter be enforced concerning tenants particular use of the leased premises. it is understood, however, that the landlord is responsible for building modifications required by governmental agencies to ensure that the leased premises are in compliance with the ada and its regulations as of the lease commencement date. if any alteration to the leased premises desired by tenant would trigger any obligation on the part of the landlord to make other changes to the building to comply with any law or regulation from which the building is otherwise exempted or grandfathered, then the landlord shall have the discretion to refuse tenants desired alteration. 9. tenants alterations tenant shall be responsible for the interior improvements of the leased premises after occupancy by tenant, and except for the installation and location of signs, equipment, counters, and other removable trade fixtures, and except as herein mentioned, tenant shall neither make any alteration nor addition to the leased premises, nor make any agreement or contract therefore, without first obtaining landlords prior written consent,

condition at tenants sole expense at the termination of the tenancy. tenant shall use a licensed contractor for all such work , which contractor must be approved in advance by landlord in writing, with landlords consent in this regard not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. prior to undertaking any such alteration work, tenant shall request in writing landlords permission for such work,

winter. the contractor is required to remove snow on the parking lots and sidewalks when snow accumulations equal or exceed 2. since snow fall is random and often frequent, and snow removal contractors typically have many accounts, the landlord does not guarantee in any way the parking lots or walkways will be cleared of snow immediately after any snow fall or be cleared by any specific time of day. therefore, it is recommended that the tenant have a hand snow shovel and at times be willing and able to clear its own walkway in from of its units door, should the need arise. osterman drive is a city street and is not required to be cleared of snow by the landlord, and the landlord makes no guarantee as to the navigability of the street in the winter. however, on rare occasion, the snow removal contractor will partially clear the street if absolutely necessary at the landlords request. any additional fee charged for such service will be considered a common area maintenance fee and the tenant agrees to pay its pro-rata share. the snow removal contractor is requested to place snow outside the parking area and not block parking stalls or the designated loading zone with accumulated or plowed snow. however, since snow fall is unpredictable the landlord makes no guarantee that some portion of parking spaces or the loading zone will not be partially or completely obstructed by snow piles. also, the use of any snow removal chemical or salt substance such as ice melt or other snow or ice melting products on the sidewalks by the tenant is strictly prohibited.

may pay and discharge the same. in this case, the amount paid by landlord shall be added to and become part of the next succeeding installment of rent, shall be deemed rent payable hereunder, and shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent from the date advanced by landlord until paid; provided, however, if tenant desires in good faith to contest the validity of any such lien, it may do so and in such event landlord shall not discharge the lien and assess additional rent until the validity of the lien is legally established. however, if landlords mortgagor legally requires and demands that the lien be released or paid, tenant shall, upon demand, cause the lien to be released by furnishing bond or otherwise.	this 1 day of february, 2019

this new lease. witnesseth: in consideration of the agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereby terminate the commercial lease agreement of january 14, 2011, effective the date hereof and landlord does hereby lease and let to tenant, and tenant does hereby lease from landlord the leased premises, hereinafter described, for the period, at the rental rate, and upon the terms and conditions set forth below. 1. leased premises the leased premises shall consist of 352 total rentable square feet, being unit a , unit b , unit f , unit c , and unit d , all being a portion of that certain building located at 7756 marshall st., orlando, fl 32808, and associated common property including parking and as depicted in the floor plan exhibit a attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. the parties agree and acknowledge that the square footage figure stipulated herein is a general figure which shall serve as the square footage of the leased premises for the purpose of calculating base rent under this lease, regardless of any actual measurements of the interior space of the leased premises, and regardless of any permitted alterations which the tenant may make to the interior of the leased premises. the ground floor footprint of 352 rentable square feet shall be used for all other purposes under this lease, including, but not limited to, the calculation of tenants prorata triple net expenses hereunder as defined in paragraph 4 hereof. the leased premises shall enjoy the right to use the parking lot and other common areas of the building in common with other tenants in the building, which common areas shall be deemed appurtenances to the leased premises, but such spaces shall not be deemed part of the leased premises hereunder in order that the respective obligations of the parties as to the leased premises shall not be confused. 2. tenant improvement allowance landlord shall perform no tenant improvements. the leased premises shall be delivered as is condition, but broom and mop clean. 3. commencement; term of lease; and option to renew the initial term of this lease shall be for a period of 4 months commencing on sep 01, 2012, and expiring on 12/31/12 . in this connection, a period from february 1 - january 31 shall be termed a lease year under this lease. lessee shall be entitled to possession and occupancy of the leased premises on 01/09/12 ; provided that this lease agreement has been executed by all parties and that the payment of the first months rental rate for all units for september 2012, the triple net expenses for all units for september 2012, and the security deposit has been made by tenant. acceptance of possession of the leased premises by tenant pursuant to paragraph 15 herein below shall be construed as recognition that the leased premises are satisfactory to tenant and fit for tenants intended use. provided tenant is not in default hereunder, tenant shall have the right and option, to be exercised in its sole discretion, to extend the term of this lease for 1 consecutive renewal terms, the first of which shall commence on 2013-01-01 and end on 2013-12-31, with the successive optional renewal terms following likewise and ending 2013-12-31. all terms and conditions of this lease shall remain in effect for all such renewal terms, save and except the base rent which shall be adjusted as applicable annually by the annual inflation rate as defined by the cpi , which increase or decrease shall not exceed 5%, from the preceding lease years base rental rate for each lease year of the renewal term. the method of calculation to be used is as follows: the annual cpi adjustment to the rents shall be calculated as follows, in accordance with exhibit b hereto: the rent for the coming option year, if so elected, shall be calculated as * prior year base rent. example: if the prior year rent is $8.25, and the cpi is hypothetically 1.5%, the calculation would be * $8.25, or , or $8.37. for the purpose of providing tenant the revised base rental rate for the renewal term in a timely fashion, the landlord will calculate the cpi 12 months percent change at least one month prior to the end of each lease year. in order to exercise this renewal option at the end of the lease term or applicable renewal term, tenant must give written notice of such renewal to landlord not later than 180 calendar days prior to the expiration of the then current lease term or renewal term. failure to give timely written notice of the exercise of the renewal option in this manner shall constitute a waiver and relinquishment of the renewal option and such renewal option shall be of no further force or effect. 4. rent a. for the first lease year of 2012 in the initial lease term tenant shall pay base rent in the annual sum of $ 113,940.00 as adjusted for 2012 by the cpi formula set forth above, payable in twelve equal monthly amounts. base rent shall adjust annually for all lease years during the initial lease term pursuant to the cpi formula set forth above. rent shall commence sep 01, 2012, and shall be payable in advance on the first day of each and every month over the initial lease term and any renewal term as applicable. b. tenant shall pay said monthly rent in said amounts in advance commencing on the rent commencement date, and on the first day of each and every month thereafter during the term of this lease. c. this is a triple net lease. in addition to its monthly base rent payment, and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, tenant shall pay its proportionate share of all real property taxes and assessments, insurance, common area maintenance and repair expenses associated with its tenancy and the property generally. common area maintenance expenses include by way of example, but are not limited to: parking lot and exterior building lighting, parking lot snow plowing/shoveling, lawn mowing/fertilization/aeration, tree and shrub trimming/fertilization/replacement, sprinkler system including well start-up, shutdown and repair, building exterior maintenance including painting, siding repair or replacement, parking lot seal coating, striping, parking sign repair or replacement, sidewalk and parking lot curb repair or replacement, roof and gutter repairs, and sewer line clean-out. triple net expenses shall additionally include water, garbage, and recycling services common to the building. tenant acknowledges that landlord shall manage the building and property generally with respect to common area maintenance and repair issues, insurance and common utility issues, etc. and shall have sole authority in this regard, with such authority to be exercised in landlords reasonable discretion. as used here, tenants proportionate share shall be calculated with tenants stipulated square footage of the footprint of the leased premises as the numerator and the total square footage of the building as the denominator. it is acknowledged that the amount assessed for common area maintenance and repair may change from time to time. such variations of actual cost in relation to the actual amount of triple net fees paid by tenant will be reviewed and accounted for by landlord and reported to tenant by april 30 of the following year. based on landlords annual review and accounting, any surplus or deficit of tenant triple net payments paid in the prior year shall be credited or debited, respectively, to the tenant by the landlord. the landlord shall set the new estimated triple net expenses amount for the coming year based on anticipated costs, and tenant shall agree to pay one-twelfth of such annual prorata charges concurrently with the base rent. all of such additional charges shall be termed the triple net expenses. tenant shall remain liable to pay to landlord upon demand any deficiency in the triple net expenses as may be determined to exist by the landlords end-of-year review and reconciliation of actual expenses, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the lease prior to the date of such end-of-year review; and conversely, landlord shall remain obligated to reimburse tenant any sum as tenant may have overpaid in triple net expenses as may be determined by such end-of-year review, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the lease prior to such determination. triple net expense records: landlord will maintain appropriate and complete accounts, records, documents and other evidence showing and supporting all calculation of triple net expenses. landlord will allow access to tenant, the montana legislative auditor and/or the montana legislative fiscal analyst, or other designated persons to all records as may be necessary for audit purposes and to determine compliance with this lease, on reasonable prior written notice. all records pertaining to triple net expenses must be retained by the landlord for a period of three years from the completion date. if any litigation, claim, or audit pertaining to this lease is started before the expiration of the three year period, the records must be retained until the litigation, claim, or audit findings have been resolved. d. triple net expenses are estimated for the 2012 portion of the first lease year of the initial lease term to be $1.95 per square foot per year , payable monthly with the base rent in an amount of $2,519.56. triple net expenses shall be in effect and payable upon occupancy 01/09/12, and continuing through the initial lease term and renewal terms if applicable. e. tenant shall pay a late fee of five percent of any base rent or triple net expense payment that is not paid on or before the end of the business day on the tenth of each month. f. the base rents shall increase or decrease pursuant to paragraph 3 above for the one-year renewal terms . for clarification, the base rental amounts do not include the monthly triple net expense charges also to be paid monthly described in paragraph 4c-d above. 5. security deposit a security deposit of $949.51 will be paid by the tenant upon the commencement date and held by the landlord at all times while this lease is in effect. the parties acknowledge that this amount is already in the possession of landlord, being the security deposit amount from the previous lease term. the security deposit shall be held by landlord without liability for interest and as security for the full and timely performance by tenant of tenants covenants and obligations under this lease, it being expressly understood that the security deposit shall not be considered an advance payment of rental or a measure or limitation of landlords damages in case of default by tenant. unless otherwise provided by mandatory non-waivable law or regulation, landlord may co-mingle the security deposit with landlords other funds. if the landlord must apply any part of the security deposit to cure any default of tenant hereunder, but the lease remains in effect, the tenant shall promptly pay to the landlord upon demand such amount as will restore the full balance of the security deposit to its original $949.51 amount. if the leased premises are in substantially as good a condition, reasonable and normal wear and tear excepted, as exists upon the commencement of this tenancy, and tenant is not in default under any other provisions of this lease and is current in all payments owed to landlord, the entire security deposit, or balance thereof after any such application to cure any default, shall be returned without interest to tenant within a reasonable time after the expiration or termination of this lease. landlord may, however, retain an amount from the security deposit as is reasonably estimated to cover any projected shortfall in tenants triple net payments as have not been reconciled at the time of the termination of this lease. 6. use tenant agrees to use the leased premises for general professional purposes relating to tenants business, described as classroom and training facility. any other use requires the prior written consent of the landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. in this connection, tenant covenants and warrants unto landlord that tenant has all applicable governmental licenses for the conduct of such business, and that tenant will not use the premises for any illegal or unlawful purpose or purposes, nor for any purpose or purposes which may unreasonably affect the general publics or building occupants health, safety, and welfare, or the welfare of the leased premises, nor for any purpose which will increase risks covered by insurance on the premises and result in an increase of the rate of insurance or cancellation of any insurance policy. tenant specifically acknowledges and agrees that tenant shall be responsible for taking such steps as are necessary to insure that the walls, flooring, and ceiling of the leased premises are adequately protected from any moisture or water damage as might result from tenants operations in the leased premises, including making such alterations or installing certain coverings or coatings on walls, floors, and or ceilings as will protect same, subject to landlords prior approval as to such measures under paragraph 9 below. 7. parking tenant acknowledges that the parking lot in front and rear of the building is for the joint use by all of the tenants in the building and their guests and invitees and that there are no designated or reserved parking spaces. parking spaces may not be used for storage of any kind including non-operating vehicles without the expressed written consent of the landlord. tenant acknowledges that snow removal activities during the winter may cause an accumulation of plowed snow in one or more areas of the parking lot which may reduce the amount of parking available to the buildings tenants and their guests and invitees and or which may impact the available space of the loading zone, on this seasonal basis. 8. compliance with public authorities tenant agrees, at tenants cost, to comply with all applicable municipal, county, state, and federal laws and regulations now in force or which may hereafter be enforced concerning tenants particular use of the leased premises. it is understood, however, that the landlord is responsible for building modifications required by governmental agencies to ensure that the leased premises are in compliance with the ada and its regulations as of the lease commencement date. if any alteration to the leased premises desired by tenant would trigger any obligation on the part of the landlord to make other changes to the building to comply with any law or regulation from which the building is otherwise exempted or grandfathered, then the landlord shall have the discretion to refuse tenants desired alteration. 9. tenants alterations tenant shall be responsible for the interior improvements of the leased premises after occupancy by tenant, and except for the installation and location of signs, equipment, counters, and other removable trade fixtures, and except as herein mentioned, tenant shall neither make any alteration nor addition to the leased premises, nor make any agreement or contract therefore, without first obtaining landlords prior written consent,

condition at tenants sole expense at the termination of the tenancy. tenant shall use a licensed contractor for all such work , which contractor must be approved in advance by landlord in writing, with landlords consent in this regard not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. prior to undertaking any such alteration work, tenant shall request in writing landlords permission for such work,

tenant will promptly reimburse landlord for the expense of such removal and storage, upon receiving landlords statement. if tenant fails to pay for such expense within thirty days of receiving

be liable for any liability arising out of or in connection with any structural defects of the leased premises or the building and improvements upon or adjacent to the leased premises. the parties

other property of either landlord or tenant in, about or upon the leased premises, as the case may be, caused by or resulting from perils, events or happenings which are covered by the insurance carried by the respective parties and in force at the time of any such loss; provided, however, that such waiver shall be effective only to the extent and amount permitted by the insurance covering such loss and to the extent such insurance is not prejudiced thereby, or the expense of such insurance is not thereby increased and further provided that such waiver shall be effective only to the extent of insurance proceeds actually received. 15. condition of leased premises upon taking possession of the leased premises on the occupancy date, tenant shall inspect the same and shall advise landlord within fifteen days of any material defects affecting tenants use and enjoyment of the premises, which might reasonably be discovered upon an inspection. if landlord does not promptly repair

with tenant that upon paying the rent and performing the terms, covenants and agreements in this lease set forth, tenant shall, at all times during the term or any extension of the term hereof, be entitled peacefully and quietly to have, hold, and enjoy the leased premises. tenant agrees to allow landlord, or its agents, reasonable access at reasonable times to show the premises to prospective buyers or lenders at any time during the term hereof; or to prospective successor tenants if tenants lease will be expiring within six months. further, landlord and its agents shall have the right to reasonable access to the leased premises at reasonable times upon no less than twenty-four hours prior notice to ascertain whether the leased premises are in good repair and or to make such repairs or maintenance which landlord may be required to make or feel desirable. the requirement of advance notice shall not apply in situations deemed to be an emergency by the landlord . the parties acknowledge that an alarm system for the premises is present and may be used by the tenant. activation, repair service and monthly monitoring fees for this alarm are the responsibility of the tenant. at all times during the term of this lease, should the alarm system be activated, tenant shall insure that landlord has the current alarm access code in order that landlord may enter the leased premises for the purposes contemplated by this lease, and tenant shall provide such code to landlord upon request at any time. further, tenant understands and acknowledges that an interior fire sprinkler system has been constructed in the building prior to the outset of this lease and has its riser station and controls located within unit a of the leased premises. landlord, and its contractors, shall have reasonable access to this space as needed to service and maintain such fire sprinkler control station, and or to permit the periodic inspection of the system by service contractors, the city and or fire department officials as may be required. 17. repair and maintenance at its expense, tenant shall keep the interior of the leased premises in good condition and repair, including by way of example, but not limitation, windows, service doors, garage doors and openers, interior wall surfaces, lighting fixtures, replacement bulbs and fluorescent tubes, pest control. if tenant refuses or neglects to commence or complete such repairs promptly and adequately, landlord may, but shall not be required to do so, make or complete the repairs; and tenant shall pay the cost thereof to landlord upon demand. tenant shall pay the cost to maintain and repair its leased spaces, noncommon mechanical systems, including but not limited to, hvac, plumbing, electrical, and lighting located upon the leased premises, after all manufacturer warranties have been exhausted. hvac for units f and b is not a common system, but routine scheduled maintenance is handled by the landlord and billed to tenant via triple net reconciliation at year end. tenant shall further be responsible and pay for any damages to the interior or exterior of the leased premises caused by tenant, its employees, agents, and business invitees. quarterly hvac roof-top unit maintenance is ordered and paid by the landlord. these annual fees and charges are included in tenants year-end triple-net charge reconciliation. overhead gas blower heater and electric baseboard heater maintenance in units c and d are the responsibility of the tenant. except as herein set forth, landlord shall repair all structural defects and exterior damages to the leased premises and shall keep the foundation, exterior walls and roof in good order and repair. in addition, landlord shall be responsible for maintenance and repair of common elements of mechanical systems, including but not limited to, plumbing, electrical, and lighting located upon the leased premises. landlord shall be responsible for scheduling maintenance of non-common unit hvac, but charges and fees for such maintenance will be paid by the tenant at year-end reconciliation. however, in the event of window or door breakage caused by burglary or vandalism, or by unknown cause, or by tenant, its employees, agents, or business invitees whether by tenant abuse or misuse, tenant shall repair the damages. if any damage is covered by either landlords or tenants insurance, the proceeds from the insurance shall be used to make the repairs. it is the landlords responsibility to contract for snow removal in the winter. the contractor is required to remove snow on the parking lots and sidewalks when snow accumulations equal or exceed 2. since snow fall is random and often frequent, and snow removal contractors typically have many accounts, the landlord does not guarantee in any way the parking lots or walkways will be cleared of snow immediately after any snow fall or be cleared by any specific time of day. therefore, it is recommended that the tenant have a hand snow shovel and at times be willing and able to clear its own walkway in from of its units door, should the need arise. osterman drive is a city street and is not required to be cleared of snow by the landlord, and the landlord makes no guarantee as to the navigability of the street in the winter. however, on rare occasion, the snow removal contractor will partially clear the street if absolutely necessary at the landlords request. any additional fee charged for such service will be considered a common area maintenance fee and the tenant agrees to pay its pro-rata share. the snow removal contractor is requested to place snow outside the parking area and not block parking stalls or the designated loading zone with accumulated or plowed snow. however, since snow fall is unpredictable the landlord makes no guarantee that some portion of parking spaces or the loading zone will not be partially or completely obstructed by snow piles. also, the use of any snow removal chemical or salt substance such as ice melt or other snow or ice melting products on the sidewalks by the tenant is strictly prohibited. the landlord provides each tenant a container of traction sand for the purpose of increasing safety on potentially slippery walkways. the traction sand is free of charge to all tenants in the building and is to be used by the tenant in reasonable amounts at its discretion. 18. cleanliness and waste tenant shall keep the leased premises, inside and outside, in a neat, clean, and sanitary condition, free from waste and other debris. receptacles are provided for trash and recycling cardboard and must be used accordingly. tenant shall not place trash or cardboard outside the receptacles. tenant shall not allow any hazardous substances to be deposited or remain in or about the leased premises. tenant shall store all items pertaining to its business operations inside the leased premises and not in common parking or walk areas. tenant shall not allow hazardous or legally prohibited liquids or solids to be placed in the sewer system or in the grounds in the area of the leased premises. at the termination of this lease, tenant shall clean and repair any and all soiling and/or damages to the leased premises, including marks, scratches, holes, dirt, and grease, and damages to the walls, floors, floor coverings, ceilings, and fixtures, normal wear and tear excepted. it is a general management policy of the landlord that pets are not allowed in the building or on the premises, with the exception of bona fide service animals and other animals specifically approved by landlord cigarette or cigar smoking is not allowed at any time in the building and is only permitted outside the building at a distance of at least 30 feet from doorways or windows. all cigarettes and cigars must be extinguished and disposed of properly and safely. littering the premises is not permitted. 19. liens tenant shall not permit any lien to be attached to the leased premises by reason of any act or omission on its part and agrees to save and hold landlord harmless from or against such lien or claim of lien. if any lien does attach and any claim of lien is made and shall not be released within fifteen days after notice from landlord to tenant to release the same, landlord, at its option, may pay and discharge the same. in this case, the amount paid by landlord shall be added to and become part of the next succeeding installment of rent, shall be deemed rent payable hereunder, and
